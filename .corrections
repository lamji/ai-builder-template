# Correction Tracking Log

| Date | Issue | Root Cause | Fix / Preventive Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-20 | Failed to follow logging rules | Overlooked `coding-standard.md` rules §11-14 | Immediate creation of `.logs.md`, `.logs/`, and `.corrections`. Mandatory rule review before every task. |
| 2026-02-20 | Skipped `npm run lint` & `build` | Assumed TSC was sufficient | Run full lint and build after every significant code change as per `troubleshooting.md`. |
| 2026-02-20 | Used `middleware.ts` in Next.js 16 | Outdated convention knowledge | Researched and migrated to `proxy.ts` convention. |
